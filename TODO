Instead of emitting Python internally, we could compile to Parrot. This
would allow actions to be written in any Parrot language, and a build
script could easily include code written in any Parrot language. Right
now, Parrot language support is rather limited, and I'm not particularly
looking forward to writing lots of PIR, so this is for a future time.
